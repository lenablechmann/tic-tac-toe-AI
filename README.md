# Tic Tac Toe Web-App
A tic tac toe game written in HTML5/CSS3/Javascript using the minimax AI and javascript module pattern.

## Specification
- create a tic tac toe game in javascript, html, css
- user should be player 1
- AI (minimax algorithm) will be player 2
- Mobile first minimalistic design with figma
- use CSS grid and flexbox for layout
- avoid global namespace polution by using the revealing module pattern
- if you need multiples of the same prototype, use factory functions

## Project Road Map
- [ ] create a basic README layout, add folders and css reset file
- [ ] create a wireframe for the interface
- [ ] create a figma layout for mobile
- [ ] create a layout for desktops
- [ ] plan out the web app with a flowchart and determine which classes/ids, objects, functions and modules you'll approximately need
- [ ] create the html+css static layout
- [ ] write a javascript base game where player 1 is the user, and player 2 chooses random cells for its moves
- [ ] write out the winning logic condition
- [ ] program how the new round will be started after the win
- [ ] keep track of the scores so far and display them on the screen
- [ ] add the AI (if you dare)

## Learning goals
- how to use the module pattern in javascript to organize your code
- how to use factory functions + prototypal inheritance
- practice debugging in developer tools
- make the user experience as fluid and as simple as possible
- understand and implement the minimax algorithm in a project (which is the foundation of game theory and AI)

## Unexpected Difficulties/Learning Experiences
- to be determined
