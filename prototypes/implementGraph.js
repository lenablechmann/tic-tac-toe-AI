// Goal is to learn to implement an unweighted, undirected graph in form of
// an adjacency list. Hopefully this will help me understand graph traversal in general

// Pseudocode:
// create an adjacency list object, that will have all nodes as keys, values will be
// an array of the neighbor nodes {A: [B, C, D]}

// create a function addNode 
// create a function addEdge ( creates a connection between nodes, 
// by adding the neighboring nodes to destination and source lists)
